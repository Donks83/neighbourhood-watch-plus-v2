# ✅ Date Type Fix for Incident Form

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/map/incident-report-form.tsx
git commit -m "fix: use Date object for incidentDateTime default value

- Changed from string to Date object in defaultValues
- IncidentFormData type expects Date, not string
- React-hook-form handles conversion for datetime-local input
- Form submission already converts to Date anyway"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- `IncidentFormData` type expects `incidentDateTime: Date`
- Was providing string from `.toISOString().slice(0, 16)`
- Changed to `new Date()` - react-hook-form handles conversion
- Form already converts to Date in handleFormSubmit

**Proper type alignment!** ✅
