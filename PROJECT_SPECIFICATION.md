### üéØ DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP (September 2025)

#### üè† Priority 1: User Address Collection System (IMMEDIATE)
**Status**: Backend complete, frontend UI components needed
**Files to create**:
- `src/components/auth/address-collection-form.tsx` 
- `src/components/map/location-search.tsx`
**Files to modify**:

- `src/components/map/camera-registration-dashboard.tsx` (address integration)

#### üîê Priority 2: Camera Verification System  
**Status**: Not implemented - design phase needed
**Approach**: Multi-level verification (GPS+time, visual code, documents)
**Estimated**: 1-2 weeks after address collection

#### üìß Priority 3: Enhanced Communications
**Status**: In-app notifications working, email integration needed
**Components**: Email templates, notification preferences, mobile push
**Estimated**: 3-5 days implementation

#### üöÄ Priority 4: Production Readiness

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Maps**: MapLibre GL JS with MapTiler (with Geocoding API)
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: Firestore
- **State**: React hooks with refs for stability

### Key Components Status
- ‚úÖ `Map`: Core map with click handling and marker management
- ‚úÖ `CameraRegistrationDashboard`: 50/50 layout property management
- ‚úÖ `CameraPopupConfig`: Compact 320px configuration popup
- ‚úÖ `IncidentReportPanel`: Slide-out incident reporting
- ‚úÖ `AuthDialog`: Authentication flows
- üîÑ `AddressCollectionForm`: In development
- ‚ùå `LocationSearch`: Not implemented
- ‚ùå `RequestManagement`: Not implemented

### Database Schema Updates
```typescript
// Updated User Profile with Address
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string
  email: string
  displayName?: string
  address?: UserAddress  // NEW
  verified: boolean
  trustScore: number
  stats: { camerasRegistered: number; requestsMade: number; footageShared: number; communityHelpScore: number }
  createdAt: Timestamp
  lastActiveAt: Timestamp
}

interface UserAddress {
  street: string
  city: string
  postcode: string
  country: string
  coordinates: Location  // Geocoded coordinates
  isVerified?: boolean
}
```

### Recent Technical Fixes Applied
- **Fixed**: Camera placement pin visibility (consolidated marker rendering systems)
- **Fixed**: Camera management UI interactions (toggle, edit, delete with proper feedback)
- **Fixed**: Community heatmap isolation (now shows ALL community cameras with fuzzy locations)
- **Enhanced**: Fuzzy location privacy (50m diameter for better anonymity)
- **Added**: Comprehensive geocoding infrastructure
- **Added**: Address validation and formatting utilities

## Privacy-First Design Principles
1. **Location Fuzzing**: All community-visible locations offset by 25m radius (50m diameter)
2. **Opt-in Sharing**: Cameras private by default
3. **Approval Required**: Footage requests need owner approval
4. **Minimal Data**: Only necessary information stored
5. **User Control**: Full control over privacy settings
6. **Address Privacy**: User addresses geocoded and stored securely

## Camera Verification System (Planned)
### Recommended Multi-Level Approach:
- **Level 1**: GPS + Time verification (automatic)
- **Level 2**: Visual code verification (user displays alphanumeric code in front of camera)
- **Level 3**: Property document verification (utility bill/council tax)
- **Bonus**: Neighbor endorsements boost trust score
