# ðŸ”§ Camera Edit Modal Fix

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/map/camera-edit-modal.tsx
git commit -m "fix: remove description field from camera edit modal

- RegisteredCamera type doesn't have description field
- Removed description from form state
- Removed description textarea from UI
- All other fields remain functional"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Removed `description` field that doesn't exist in `RegisteredCamera` type
- Removed description textarea from UI
- Form now only uses fields that actually exist on the camera object

This should be it! ðŸŽ¯
