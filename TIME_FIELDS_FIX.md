# ðŸ”§ Final Camera Edit Fix

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/map/camera-edit-modal.tsx
git commit -m "fix: remove non-existent time fields from camera edit

- Removed allowedTimeStart and allowedTimeEnd (don't exist in type)
- privacySettings only has: shareWithCommunity, requireApproval, maxRequestRadius, autoRespond, quietHours
- Form now only uses existing properties"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Removed `allowedTimeStart` and `allowedTimeEnd` from form state
- These properties don't exist on `privacySettings` type
- Removed time input fields from UI
- Form now works with only actual properties

THIS should be the final TypeScript error! ðŸŽ¯
