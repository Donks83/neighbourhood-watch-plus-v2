# ‚ú® Feature Addition: Visual Markers for Footage Registration

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Features Added**:
1. Blue circle marker when selecting footage location (8m radius)
2. Maintained red circle marker for incident reports (200m radius)

---

## üé® What Was Added

### 1. Blue Circle Marker for Footage Location
When a user clicks "I Have Footage" and then clicks on the map:
- **Blue circle** appears at clicked location
- **8 meter radius** (much smaller than incident report radius)
- **Pulsing animation** for visibility
- **Automatically clears** when form is closed or cancelled

### 2. Visual Distinction
- **Blue** = Footage location (where camera recorded)
- **Red** = Incident location (where incident occurred and footage is needed)

---

## üìù Changes Made

### File 1: `src/app/page.tsx`
Added new props to Map component:
```typescript
<Map
  // ... existing props
  temporaryMarkerLocation={temporaryMarkerLocation}  // New: footage location
  temporaryMarkerRadius={8}                          // New: 8 meter radius
  // ... other props
/>
```

### File 2: `src/components/map/map.tsx`

**Added to interface**:
```typescript
interface MapProps {
  // ... existing props
  temporaryMarkerLocation?: Location | null  // New prop
  temporaryMarkerRadius?: number            // New prop (default: 8)
  // ... other props
}
```

**Added to component destructuring**:
```typescript
const Map = forwardRef<MapRef, MapProps>(function Map({
  // ... existing props
  temporaryMarkerLocation,
  temporaryMarkerRadius = 8,  // Default 8 meters
  // ... other props
}, ref) {
```

**Added new useEffect** (after selectedLocation effect):
- Renders blue circle with 8m radius
- Adds center point marker (blue)
- Adds pulsing animation
- Properly cleans up layers when location cleared

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### Footage Registration Flow (NEW VISUAL FEEDBACK)
1. User clicks **"I Have Footage"** button
   - Button shows pulsing ring animation ‚úÖ
   - Slide-out panel appears from right ‚úÖ
2. User clicks on map at footage location
   - **Blue circle** (8m radius) appears at location ‚ú® **NEW**
   - **Blue center dot** with pulsing animation ‚ú® **NEW**
   - Footage registration form opens ‚úÖ
3. User fills out and submits form
   - Blue marker disappears ‚úÖ
   - Success message shown ‚úÖ

### Incident Reporting Flow (UNCHANGED)
1. User clicks on map (without clicking "I Have Footage")
   - **Red circle** (200m radius) appears at location ‚úÖ
   - **Red center dot** with pulsing animation ‚úÖ
   - Incident report form opens ‚úÖ
2. User fills out and submits form
   - Red marker disappears ‚úÖ
   - Success message shown ‚úÖ

## üé® Visual Design

### Blue Circle (Footage)
- **Color**: `#3b82f6` (blue-500)
- **Radius**: 8 meters
- **Fill Opacity**: 15%
- **Stroke**: 2px dashed blue
- **Center Point**: 8px blue circle, white stroke
- **Animation**: Pulsing effect

### Red Circle (Incident)
- **Color**: `#ef4444` (red-500)
- **Radius**: 200 meters (default, adjustable in form)
- **Fill Opacity**: 15%
- **Stroke**: 2px dashed red
- **Center Point**: 8px red circle, white stroke
- **Animation**: Pulsing effect

---

## üîß Technical Details

### Radius Calculation
Both circles use the same `createCircleGeoJSON` helper function that:
1. Takes center location and radius in meters
2. Creates 64-point polygon approximating a circle
3. Accounts for Earth's curvature using lat/lng conversion

### Layer Management
Each marker type has 4 map layers:
1. Fill layer (colored circle)
2. Stroke layer (dashed border)
3. Point layer (center dot)
4. Pulse layer (animation)

All layers are properly cleaned up when markers change or are removed.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **Visual Confirmation**: Users see exactly where their footage location is marked
2. **Radius Awareness**: 8m circle shows the approximate area of footage coverage
3. **Professional UX**: Pulsing animation draws attention to selected location
4. **Clear Distinction**: Blue vs Red makes it obvious which type of marker it is
5. **Clean State**: Markers automatically clear when forms are closed

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test Blue Circle (Footage)
- [ ] Click "I Have Footage" button
- [ ] Click anywhere on map
- [ ] Verify **blue circle** appears (not red)
- [ ] Verify circle is **much smaller** than incident circle (8m vs 200m)
- [ ] Verify blue center dot is visible
- [ ] Verify pulsing animation works
- [ ] Open footage form, verify marker stays visible
- [ ] Close form, verify marker disappears
- [ ] Press ESC during location selection, verify no marker appears

### Test Red Circle (Incident) - Should Still Work
- [ ] Click on map (without clicking "I Have Footage")
- [ ] Verify **red circle** appears (not blue)
- [ ] Verify circle is **larger** (200m default)
- [ ] Verify incident form opens
- [ ] Verify marker clears after form closes

### Test Marker Switching
- [ ] Click "I Have Footage", then click map ‚Üí Blue marker
- [ ] Close footage form
- [ ] Click map again ‚Üí Red marker (incident)
- [ ] Verify markers don't overlap or conflict
