# ðŸŽ¯ Firestore Timestamp Fix

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/map/camera-edit-modal.tsx
git commit -m "fix: convert Firestore Timestamps to Date objects

- Firestore Timestamps need .toDate() before calling date methods
- Added optional chaining for safety
- Added 'N/A' fallback for missing dates
- Check both lastUpdated and updatedAt (field name varies)"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Firestore `Timestamp` objects need `.toDate()` to convert to JavaScript `Date`
- Then we can call `.toLocaleDateString()`
- Added safe chaining: `camera.createdAt?.toDate?.()?.toLocaleDateString()`
- Fallback to 'N/A' if date is missing

**This is it! Final TypeScript fix!** ðŸŽ¯
