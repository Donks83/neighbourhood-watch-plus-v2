# ✅ Timestamp Conversion Fix #2

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/map/camera-registration-dashboard.tsx
git commit -m "fix: convert createdAt Timestamp in camera list

- Added .toDate() conversion before calling .toLocaleDateString()
- Same Firestore Timestamp issue in camera list display
- Consistent with other timestamp handling in the app"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Camera list was displaying `createdAt` without converting from Timestamp
- Added `camera.createdAt?.toDate?.()?.toLocaleDateString()`
- Added fallback `|| 'N/A'` for safety
- Same pattern as other Timestamp conversions

**Comprehensive Timestamp handling!** ✅
