# 🎉 TEMPORARY EVIDENCE MARKERS - COMPLETE! 

## ✅ ALL TASKS COMPLETED (100%)

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` - Added button & component rendering
2. ✅ `src/lib/footage-requests.ts` - Updated matching to include temporary markers
3. ✅ `src/components/map/camera-registration-dashboard.tsx` - Added 2km validation

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. "I Have Footage" Button
- **Location**: Bottom right of screen (blue button, above red incident button)
- **Function**: Allows witnesses to register temporary footage markers
- **User Flow**:
  1. Click button
  2. Click map location
  3. Fill form
  4. Submit
  5. Footage registered for 14 days

### 2. TemporaryMarkerRegistration Component Rendering
- **Location**: Rendered after RequestManagement component
- **Condition**: Shows when user logged in + location selected
- **Integration**: Fully connected to state management

### 3. Evidence Request Matching
- **Old**: Only searched permanent cameras
- **New**: Searches BOTH permanent cameras AND temporary markers
- **Result**: Victims now get matched with:
  - ✅ Registered camera owners
  - ✅ Witnesses with mobile/dashcam footage

### 4. Notification System
- **Camera Owners**: "X cameras may have captured footage"
- **Marker Owners**: "Footage Match Found! Someone needs your footage!"
- **Channels**: App notification + Email (ready) + SMS (infrastructure ready)

### 5. Geographic Validation (2km)
- **Permanent Cameras**: Must be within 2km of registered address
- **Temporary Markers**: NO distance restriction (mobile devices move)
- **Validation**: Checks before camera save, shows helpful error messages
