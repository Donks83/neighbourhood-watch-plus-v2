# ðŸ”§ Admin Component Fix

Run to push:

```powershell
git add src/components/admin/admin-verification-queue.tsx
git commit -m "fix: remove camera location section from admin queue

- Removed location verification UI that accessed non-existent cameraLocation property
- VerificationQueueItem type doesn't include camera coordinates
- Can be re-added later when coordinates are included in queue items"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Removed UI section trying to access `item.cameraLocation.coordinates`
- This property doesn't exist in the `VerificationQueueItem` type
- Admin queue now shows address info only (street, city, postcode)

This is the final TypeScript error! ðŸŽ¯
