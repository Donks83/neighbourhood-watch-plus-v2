# üöÄ PROJECT HANDOVER - Neighbourhood Watch+ Development

## üìã CURRENT SESSION SUMMARY

### **Project**: Neighbourhood Watch+ v2.0
**Location**: `C:\Claude\neighbourhood-watch-plus-v2`
**Tech Stack**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Firebase, MapLibre GL, Tailwind CSS

---

## üéØ WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

We're implementing a **Temporary Evidence Markers** feature that allows witnesses to register incident footage they captured on mobile devices, dashcams, or action cameras. This is NOT a permanent evidence storage site - it's a 14-day temporary matching system to connect witnesses with victims who need footage.

### **Key Concept**:
- Witness captures incident on phone/dashcam ‚Üí Places temporary marker (invisible to public)
- Victim reports incident ‚Üí System matches with nearby temporary markers
- Both parties connect ‚Üí Witness shares footage directly (not stored on platform)
- Marker auto-expires after 14 days

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION

### 1. **Type Definitions** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/types/temporary-evidence/index.ts`
- Created complete TypeScript interfaces for temporary markers
- Device types: mobile_phone, dashcam, action_camera, other
- Notification preferences structure
- Geographic validation types

### 2. **Firestore Service** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/lib/temporary-evidence-service.ts`
- `TemporaryMarkerService` - CRUD operations for markers
- `NotificationPreferenceService` - Multi-channel notifications (app/email/SMS)
- `GeographicValidationService` - 2km radius restriction for permanent cameras
- Auto-expiry after 14 days
- Confidence scoring and matching algorithm
- Reward calculation based on device type and confidence

### 3. **Registration UI Component** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/components/temporary-evidence/temporary-marker-registration.tsx`
- Beautiful slide-out panel design
- Device type selection with icons
- Date/time picker with quick presets
- Optional preview image upload (max 5MB)
- SMS notification opt-in
- Form validation with Zod schema

### 4. **Main Page Integration** ‚úÖ (PARTIALLY)
- **File**: `src/app/page.tsx`
- ‚úÖ Import added for TemporaryMarkerRegistration
- ‚úÖ State management added (isTemporaryMarkerFormOpen, temporaryMarkerLocation, isSubmittingTemporaryMarker)
- ‚úÖ Handler functions created (handleTemporaryMarkerSubmit, handleOpenTemporaryMarkerForm)
- ‚úÖ Map click handler updated to support BOTH incident reporting AND temporary markers

---

## ‚è≥ STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE

### **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS** (15 minutes):

#### 1. Add "I Have Footage" Button
**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` around line ~420 (after the red Report Incident button)

```tsx
{/* I Have Footage Button - NEW */}
<div className="absolute bottom-24 right-6 z-[1000]">
  <Button
    size="lg"
    className="rounded-full shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl transition-all bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white flex items-center gap-2 px-6"
    onClick={() => {
      if (!user) {
        setIsAuthDialogOpen(true)
      } else {
        alert('Click anywhere on the map where you recorded the incident')
      }
    }}
  >
    <CameraIcon className="w-5 h-5" />
    <span className="text-sm font-medium">I Have Footage</span>
  </Button>
</div>
```

#### 2. Add TemporaryMarkerRegistration Component
**Location**: `src/app/page.tsx` around line ~550 (after RequestManagement component)

```tsx
{/* Temporary Evidence Marker Registration - NEW */}
{user && temporaryMarkerLocation && (
  <TemporaryMarkerRegistration
    isOpen={isTemporaryMarkerFormOpen}
    onClose={() => {
      setIsTemporaryMarkerFormOpen(false)
      setTemporaryMarkerLocation(null)
    }}
    location={temporaryMarkerLocation}
    onSubmit={handleTemporaryMarkerSubmit}
    isSubmitting={isSubmittingTemporaryMarker}
  />
)}
```

#### 3. Update Evidence Request Matching
**File**: `src/lib/footage-requests.ts`
- Modify `createFootageRequest` to search BOTH:
  - Permanent registered cameras
  - Active temporary markers (using TemporaryMarkerService.findMatchingMarkers)
- Combine results and send notifications to all matches

#### 4. Add Geographic Validation for Permanent Cameras
**File**: `src/components/map/camera-registration-dashboard.tsx`
- Before allowing camera registration, call `GeographicValidationService.validateCameraLocation`
- Show error if camera is >2km from user's registered address
- Allow users to add multiple addresses (home + business)

---

## üé® UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS TO CONSIDER

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Better Map Click UX**: Instead of window.confirm, create a nice modal with two big buttons:
   - "üö® Report Incident" (request footage)
   - "üì± I Have Footage" (register as witness)

2. **Temporary Marker Dashboard**: Show users their active temporary markers with:
   - Countdown to expiry
   - Number of requests matched
   - Option to extend/withdraw

3. **Success Animations**: Add confetti or success animation when marker is registered

---

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES

### **Important Context**:
1. **No Evidence Storage**: Platform NEVER stores actual footage - only facilitates connections
2. **Privacy First**: Temporary marker locations NOT visible on public map
3. **2km Restriction**: Only for PERMANENT cameras, NOT for temporary markers (mobile/dashcam can be anywhere)
4. **14-Day Expiry**: Automatic cleanup via `TemporaryMarkerService.cleanupExpiredMarkers()`
5. **Multi-Channel Notifications**: App + Email + SMS (if phone provided)

### **Firebase Collections**:
- `temporaryEvidenceMarkers` - Temporary marker data
- `notificationPreferences` - User notification settings
- `temporaryMarkerMatches` - Match history

### **Dependencies Already Installed**:
- All UI components (Switch, Slider) already created
- Premium features infrastructure in place
- Firebase storage configured for preview images

---

## üö® KNOWN ISSUES TO FIX

1. **EnhancedIncidentReportPanel**: Not currently used, should replace IncidentReportPanel for premium users
2. **Preview Image Upload**: Need to test actual Firebase Storage upload
3. **Notification Service**: Currently console.log only - needs real email/SMS integration
4. **Auto-Expiry Job**: Need to set up Cloud Function or cron job to run `cleanupExpiredMarkers()`

---

## üéØ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

**To continue development, do this:**

1. ‚úÖ Add the "I Have Footage" button to page.tsx (2 minutes)
2. ‚úÖ Add the TemporaryMarkerRegistration component to page.tsx (2 minutes)
3. ‚úÖ Test the complete flow: Click map ‚Üí Choose "I Have Footage" ‚Üí Fill form ‚Üí Submit
4. ‚úÖ Update evidence matching to include temporary markers (10 minutes)
5. ‚úÖ Add 2km validation for permanent cameras (5 minutes)
6. ‚úÖ Test end-to-end: Witness registers footage ‚Üí Victim requests ‚Üí Both get matched

---

## üí¨ USER'S ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS

From the user's clarification:
- ‚úÖ Mobile/dashcam footage registration (NOT permanent cameras)
- ‚úÖ Temporary 2-week markers
- ‚úÖ Only matches with evidence requests (not publicly visible)
- ‚úÖ Geographic restriction: 2km for PERMANENT cameras only, NO restriction for temporary markers
- ‚úÖ All portable devices supported: mobile, dashcam, action camera, other
- ‚úÖ Optional preview image (helps but not required)
- ‚úÖ Same rewards as permanent cameras
- ‚úÖ Multi-channel notifications: App + Email + SMS
