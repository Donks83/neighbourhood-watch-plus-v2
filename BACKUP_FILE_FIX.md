# 🗑️ Remove Backup File from Compilation

Run to push:

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "fix: move backup file out of src to prevent compilation

- Moved camera-registration-dashboard-backup.tsx to root as .txt
- Backup files with markdown syntax (#) can't be compiled
- File is preserved but won't be processed by TypeScript"
git push origin main
```

**What was fixed:**
- Backup file had markdown comment `#` which isn't valid TypeScript
- Moved file from `src/components/map/` to project root
- Changed extension to `.txt` so it's not compiled
- Content preserved but won't interfere with build

**This was the issue!** The backup file was being compiled! 🎯
