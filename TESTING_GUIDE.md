2. Create evidence request:
   - Location: Between A and B
   - Time: 10:03 AM
   - Radius: 500m

### Scenario B: Time Window Matching
**Goal**: Verify markers outside time window don't match

1. Register temporary marker:
   - Device: Mobile Phone
   - Time: 2 days ago, 3:00 PM

2. Create evidence request:
   - Location: Same spot

2. Navigate to Firestore
3. Look for collection: `temporaryEvidenceMarkers`
4. Verify document has:
   ```
   {
     ownerId: "user-id",
     ownerEmail: "user@example.com",
     location: { lat: X, lng: Y },
     deviceType: "mobile_phone",
     recordedAt: Timestamp,
     expiresAt: Timestamp (14 days from now),
     isActive: true,
     ...
